# TTP_Assignment4

<h2>Goal:</h2>
<p>Further demonstrate understanding of DOM manipulation, events, and forms. Build familiarity with JS syntax.<p>
<h3>Direction:<h3/>
<p>It is up to you and your group: either make separate HTML files for each prompt, or organize the assignment such that everything is on one page. If you want to run the same JavaScript on several pages in a web site, you should create an external JavaScript file, instead of writing the same script over and over again. Save the script file with a .js extension, and then refer to it using the src attribute in the <script> tag.
Example: <script src="myscripts.js"></script>
Where To Put Your Script Tag? </p>
